### Hi, I'm Willie ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist and engineer and I'm from Taiwan!

I'm a big fan for MLOps, passionate about leveraging data to derive valuable insights, intelligence via AI models and automatic workflows.

I am dedicated to build automatic, robust, efficient, and reliable machine learning systems and applciations.

I believe that in the post-ChatGPT era, fine-tuning model of LLM + MLOps will be a major trend.

Furthermore, I am the first author of a paper proposing an attentive graph neural network for financial time-series predicion. This [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1566253522001750) was published in a top-tier computer science journal called Information Fusion.
